# Photo Expo – Sidebar UI

This is my first small CSS project.
I created a sidebar layout using basic CSS concepts
such as positioning, spacing, and layout techniques.

This project helped me understand how sidebar menus
are built in real websites.

I will keep improving my skills and adding
more projects as I continue learning.
